`passgen` is a command-line password generator, written in C++. Currently, the program is in version 0.1.0, and, supports most of the features you normally find in password generators, like:

1. define the length of the password to be generated;
2. include numbers and special characters in the password;
3. exclude upper and lower case letters;

# Features

- `passgen` uses only C++ 11 Standard Library, so, is very easy build;
- Have a option to generate multiple passwords at once;
- Can generate "number-only", or, "special-chars-only" passwords;
